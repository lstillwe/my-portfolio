      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am an experienced software developer, and have recently acquired new skills in full stack web development. I love learning new technologies and I am continually adding to my skill set. I enjoy the company of family, friends and dogs and many outdoor and indoor tech activities. I like gardening, biking, fishing and canoeing, and dabbling in Arduino electronics.</p>
