## Description
This repository contains a REACT built version of my portfolio. I hope to continually update this repo with updates of projects I work on and new skills I learn. This portfolio site is meant to demonstrate skills using REACT components and hooks to create a responsive one page website that appears to be composed of several pages. It dislpays About, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume sections.
